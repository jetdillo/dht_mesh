# dht_mesh
Some code for reading/transmitting DHT(Dewpoint,Temperature,Humidity) data from different [Particle IO](http://particle.io) boards
to each other and out to the Particle Cloud. 

I'm using these for monitoring the environment in my 3D printer, filament box and dryer, but they might be useful to others as examples of how to ship data around a Particle Mesh network.
